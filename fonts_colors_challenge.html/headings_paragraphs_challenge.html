		<p>It was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the
Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day’s
rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws
one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their
tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped
across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon
shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived.
‘Augrh!’ said Father Wolf. ‘It is time to hunt again.’ He
was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a
bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: ‘Good luck
go with you, O Chief of the Wolves.</P>

<h2>And good luck</h2><p> and
strong white teeth go with noble children that they may
never forget the hungry in this world.’It was the jackal—Tabaqui, the Dish-licker—and the
wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about
making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and
pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. But they
are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone
else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the
forest biting everything in his way</p>

<h3>even the tiger</h3><p> runs and
hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the
most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature.
We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee—the
madness— and run.
‘Enter, then, and look,’ said Father Wolf stiffly, ‘but
there is no food here.’
‘For a wolf, no,’ said Tabaqui, ‘but for so mean a
person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we,
the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?</p>

<h4>he scuttled to</h4><p> the back of the cave, where he found the bone
of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end
merrily.
‘All thanks for this good meal,’ he said, licking his lips.
‘How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their
eyes! And so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the
beginning.’
Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is
nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their
faces. It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look
uncomfortable. </p>

<h5>Tabaqui sat still</h5><p> rejoicing in the mischief that he had
made, and then he said spitefully:
‘Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting
grounds. He will hunt among these hills for the next
moon, so he has told me.’
Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the
Waingunga River, twenty miles away.
‘He has no right!’ Father Wolf began angrily—‘By the
Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters
without due warning. He will frighten every head of game
within ten miles, and I—I have to kill for two, these days.’ </p>
